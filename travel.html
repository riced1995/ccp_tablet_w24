                architecture and revered Buddha image. Chiang Mai's historical sites provide a captivating glimpse into

                <p>Rome is one of the oldest metropolitan areas in the world. With a history dating back to 700 BC with
                    the birth of the
                    Roman Empire, the city has maintained its status as a cultural and historical hub of Europe. The
                    city is peppered with
                    ancient monuments, statues, and piazzas from different eras of history. The most famous location,
                    the Colosseum, is
                    touted as one of the seven modern wonders of the world. Rome houses several world famous museums,
                    such as the Borghese
                    and the Vatican Museum. It is also the only city in the world to encompass a recognized country,
                    Vatican City.</p>

                <p>Rome is also a great location for food, wine, and leisure. At the heart of Italy, Rome is a central
                    gathering place for

                    most famous dish is carbonara. Beyond the food, Rome has a vibrant nightlife. The Trastevere
                    neighborhood has plenty of
